# 0x03. Queuing System in JavaScript

This project focuses on implementing a queuing system using Redis and Kue (a priority job queue backed by Redis) in JavaScript. Redis is an open-source, in-memory data structure store, used as a database, cache, and message broker. Kue is a priority job queue backed by Redis, which allows us to create jobs that can be processed later, prioritizing them based on their importance.

## Resources

Before starting, ensure you have a basic understanding of the following resources:

- **Redis Quick Start**: Familiarize yourself with Redis basics, including installation, configuration, and basic commands. This will help you understand how Redis works and its role in our queuing system.
  
- **Redis Client Interface**: Learn about interacting with Redis through its client interface. Knowing how to send commands and receive responses from Redis is crucial for implementing our queuing system.
  
- **Redis Client for Node.js**: Since we're working within a Node.js environment, understanding how to integrate Redis with Node.js is essential. This includes setting up the Redis client in your Node.js application and executing Redis commands programmatically.
  
- **Kue**: Although Kue has been deprecated, it's still widely used in the industry due to its simplicity and effectiveness for managing background jobs. Understanding how Kue works with Redis will be key to implementing our queuing system.

## Getting Started

To get started with this project, follow these steps:

1. **Install Redis**: Ensure Redis is installed and running on your machine. You can download Redis from the official website or install it using package managers like `apt` for Ubuntu or `brew` for macOS.

2. **Set Up Your Project**: Create a new directory for your project and initialize it with `npm init`. Install the necessary packages, including `redis` for Node.js and `kue`.

3. **Implement the Queuing System**: Using the knowledge gained from the resources above, implement a simple queuing system. This should involve creating jobs, adding them to the queue, and processing them based on their priority.

4. **Test Your Implementation**: Write tests to ensure your queuing system works as expected. This could involve adding jobs to the queue and verifying they are processed correctly.

## Example Code Snippet

Here's a basic example of how to add a job to the queue using Kue:

```javascript
const kue = require('kue');

// Connect to Redis
const q = kue.createQueue();

// Add a job to the queue
q.create('email', {
    title: 'Email Job',
    to: 'example@example.com',
    template: 'email_template'
}).save(function(err){
    if (!err) console.log('Job added');
});
```

This snippet demonstrates connecting to Redis via Kue, creating a job type named "email", and saving it to the queue. The job details include the recipient email address and the template to be used.

## Conclusion

By following the guidance provided in the resources and implementing the steps outlined here, you'll be able to build a robust queuing system using Redis and Kue in JavaScript. This project will enhance your understanding of asynchronous task management and the power of Redis as a backend service.
